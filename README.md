# Pandas Challenge  
In this projcet I applied some of what I have learned in Pandas and completed on project based on Heros of Pymoli.  
The analysis covers the following
## Player Count  
This adds the overall player count.  
## Purchasing Analysis (Total)  
Created a data frame for the number of unique items, average price, number of purchases, and total revenue.  
## Gender Demographics 
Created a data frame for genders based on total count, and percentage of players  
## Purchasing Analysis (Gender)  
Created a data frame for genders based on purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase value, and average total purchase per person.  
## Age Demographics  
Created bins to seperate data by age groups, and created a data frame based on the total counts per age group, and percentage of players per age group.  
## Purchasing Analysis (Age)  
Used same bins as Age Demographics and created a data frame for purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase volume, and average total purchase per person based by age groups.  
## Top Spenders
Create a data frame that groups SN's by purchase counts, average purchase price, and total purchase value per player in descending order.  
## Most Popular Items  
Created a data frame that grouped Item ID and Item Name to see what was the most popular by purchase count, then has the item price, and the total purchase value; organinzed in decending order so the most purchased items are on top.  
## Most Profitable ITems  
Sorted the table for the Most Popular Items by total purchase values.  
## Report  
Created a report to mark down three observations taken from the data.
